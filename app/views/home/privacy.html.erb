		<h2>A & M Creamery Privacy Policy</h2>

		<p>The A & M Creamery privacy policy is very simple, rarely  

			changes, and does not require a lawyer to understand it.  

			We will pounce on the opportunity to sell every bit of information 

			on you they have at our disposal.  We will gladly sell your address, 

			phone, email, age, name of pet, name of favorite superhero, color of 

			bunny slippers you wear at home, and the like, to any willing buyer 

			who will pay the big bucks.  (BTW, we know  you wear bunny 

			slippers at home and we know what color they are.  You really have 

			no secrets from this crew.)  If you have sensitive information that 

			you don't want us to share with the world, then keep it to yourself 

			-- don't tell us.  

			<br><br>

			It's really that simple.
